        <li>Flexbox is a layout method aimed at providing a more efficient way to use space within a container.[1]</li>
        <li>To start using the flexbox model, you first have to make some container element flexible. You do this by assigning the flex property.
            <ul>  <li>i.e.; display: flex or display: inline-flex</ul></li></li>
        <li>The flexbox model contains two elements
  <ol><li> Flex container</li>
      <li>Flex items (items within a container)</li></ol></li>
        <li>You can change many properties within the flexbox model including, direction, flow, spacing between items, order of flex items, and vertical space (stretch).[2]</li>
        <li>Most browsers at this point support flexbox without prefixes. Currently, Internet Expolorer requires the –ms- prefix and UC Browser uses the –webkit- prefix.[3]</li>
        <li>There may be issues with backwards compatibility with some very old browsers, but generally flexbox is widely used. [3]</li>
        <li>There are many uses for flexbox in page layout including navigation, photo galleries, and form input fields.</li>
    </ul>
